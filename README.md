# Medha Sawhney's Website  

Hi, Iâ€™m **Medha Sawhney**, a PhD student in Computer Science at *Virginia Tech*, working on **physics-guided machine learning**, **diffusion models**, and **inverse problems in physics**. My research lies at the intersection of **AI, physics, and scientific discovery**, and I am passionate about applying generative models to advance scientific understanding.  

This repository hosts the source code for my personal website, where I share my **research, publications, and projects**.
