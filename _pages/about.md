Greetings! I am currently embarking on a very special journey as a PhD student in the [Computer Science department](https://cs.vt.edu/) at Virginia Tech under the guidance of my advisor [Dr. Anuj Karpatne](https://people.cs.vt.edu/karpatne/). This academic pursuit holds immense significance to me as it presents a continuous learning experience, where every step brings new insights and knowledge. As a member of the Science-Guided Machine Learning Lab, I find joy in exploring the endless possibilities of machine learning and its application in contributing back to the world of science.

Prior to joining the PhD program, I completed my Master's here at VT, and during which I had the privilege of interning at Twitter as an MLE Intern. My academic journey began with a Bachelor's in Electronics and Communication Engineering from [Manipal Institute of Technology, MAHE, Manipal](https://manipal.edu/mit.html). Before pursuing my Master's, I gained invaluable industry experience as a full-time ML engineer at HP Inc, Bangalore.

Throughout this exciting path, I have developed a profound passion for interdisciplinary research. Currently, I am engrossed in exploring the intriguing realms of cell behaviors and bacteria motility behaviors, utilizing machine learning and computer vision based techniques to gain deeper insights into these fascinating phenomena.

This academic website serves as a window into my research journey and findings. I wholeheartedly welcome and encourage anyone with similar interests or curiosities to reach out and engage in thought-provoking intellectual discussions. Your insights and perspectives are invaluable to me, and I am eager to connect with fellow enthusiasts. Please feel free to drop me an email!
