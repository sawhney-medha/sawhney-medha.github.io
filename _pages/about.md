Greetings! I am a PhD student in the Computer Science department at [Virginia Tech](https://cs.vt.edu) under the guidance of my advisor [Dr. Anuj Karpatne](https://people.cs.vt.edu/karpatne/).

Prior to joining the PhD program, I completed my Master's here at VT, during which I had the privilege of interning at [Twitter](https://about.twitter.com/en) as an MLE Intern. My academic journey began with a Bachelor's in Electronics and Communication Engineering from [Manipal Institute of Technology, MAHE, Manipal, India](https://manipal.edu/mit.html). Before pursuing my Master's, I gained invaluable industry experience as a full-time ML engineer at [HP](https://www.hp.com/us-en/home.html), Bangalore.

I work at the Science Guided Machine Learning Lab at Virginia Tech where my research is at the intersection of machine learning and established scientific principles. My current work involves investigating cell behaviors and bacteria motility behaviors, employing biological formulations, machine learning, and computer vision techniques with the broader aim of advancing scientific discovery.

This academic website serves as a window into my research journey and findings and I'm eager to connect with like-minded individuals. Please feel free to drop me an email!
