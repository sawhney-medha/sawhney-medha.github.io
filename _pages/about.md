Greetings! I am a PhD student in the Computer Science department at [Virginia Tech](https://cs.vt.edu) under the guidance of my advisor [Dr. Anuj Karpatne](https://people.cs.vt.edu/karpatne/).

My primary focus is on using generative AI (Diffusion models, VLMs) for solving and discovering equations through image-based and multimodal learning.

Broadly, my research lies at the intersection of **AI for science**: developing machine learning to accelerate scientific discovery, and **Science for AI**: using scientific principles to improve model robustness and generalization. I’ve contributed to diverse domains including physics, geophysics, biology, and aquatic sciences through both independent and collaborative projects.

My research works include:
 - **Diffusion models** for solving PDEs in sparse, noisy, and out-of-distribution settings using physics-informed learning, with extensions to super-resolution and inpainting.
 - **Invertible Neural networks** and Normalizing Flows for full waveform inversion in geophysics, analyzing how best to learn latent spaces for reconstruction versus manifold learning. ([GFI’25](https://kgml-lab.github.io/projects/GFI-framework/)).
 - **Computer Vision** for biomedical applications, including tiny object tracking and motion detection for cancer research, and inverse modeling of cellular forces.([MEMTRACK’24](https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/aisy.202300590) , [DLFM'22](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.24.513423v2))
 - **Foundation models** for aquatic science, modeling lake dynamics from real-world sensor data, with a focus on pretraining strategies and handling highly sparse (>95%) observational data. ([LakeFM’25](https://openreview.net/forum?id=hxMPNdhfIO))
 - **Vision-language models (VLMs)** for open-world scene graph generation ([OW-SGG’25](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08189)), biological trait prediction ([VLM4Bio’24](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2024/file/eced4a5fbc776e81b45e2f72447f0164-Paper-Datasets_and_Benchmarks_Track.pdf)), and physical equation discovery from visual inputs—addressing challenges in prompting and generating structured outputs.

My broader goal is to advance machine learning methods while solving real-world scientific challenges.



During my PhD, I have interned as a Machine Learning Engineer Intern (MLE) at [Twitter](https://about.twitter.com/en) and [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/), where I gained valuable experience applying cutting-edge techniques in AI. Prior to starting my PhD, I worked as a full-time ML Engineer at [HP](https://www.hp.com/us-en/home.html), Bangalore, and hold a Bachelor’s in Electronics and Communication Engineering from [Manipal Institute of Technology, MAHE, Manipal, India](https://manipal.edu/mit.html). Currently I am a Research Assistant at the [Knowledge Guided Machine Learning](https://kgml-lab.github.io/).
