Greetings! I am a PhD student in the Computer Science department at [Virginia Tech](https://cs.vt.edu) under the guidance of my advisor [Dr. Anuj Karpatne](https://people.cs.vt.edu/karpatne/).

I am part of the [Knowledge Guided Machine Learning Lab](https://kgml-lab.github.io/), where my research lies at the intersection of machine learning and scientific discovery. Currently, my focus is on solving inverse problems in physics through generative AI, leveraging diffusion models and physics-informed neural networks. My earlier work explored the intersection of biology and computer vision, particularly studying cell behaviors and bacterial motility.


During my PhD, I have interned as a Machine Learning Engineer Intern (MLE) at [Twitter](https://about.twitter.com/en) and [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/), where I gained valuable experience applying cutting-edge techniques in AI. Prior to starting my PhD, I worked as a full-time ML Engineer at [HP](https://www.hp.com/us-en/home.html), Bangalore, and hold a Bachelor’s in Electronics and Communication Engineering from [Manipal Institute of Technology, MAHE, Manipal, India](https://manipal.edu/mit.html).


Feel free to get in touch—I’m excited to collaborate and connect!
