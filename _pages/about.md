I am a PhD student at the [Knowledge Guided Machine Learning Lab](https://kgml-lab.github.io/) advised by [Dr. Anuj Karpatne](https://people.cs.vt.edu/karpatne/).

My research focuses on generative AI for complex scientific systems. In particular, I work primarily with diffusion models and vision-language systems, studying how generative models can learn and enforce domain-specific structures, such as physical laws or motion dynamics, from images and videos. 

I’ve contributed to diverse domains through both independent and collaborative projects. My research works include:
<!-- including physics, geophysics, biology, and aquatic sciences through both independent and collaborative projects.  -->
- **Diffusion models** for solving PDEs in sparse, noisy, and out-of-distribution settings via physics-informed learning, with extensions to super-resolution and inpainting.
- **Invertible neural networks** & normalizing flows for full waveform inversion, exploring latents for reconstruction vs. manifold-learning. ([GFI-ICLR'25](https://kgml-lab.github.io/projects/GFI-framework/))
- **Object tracking** for biomedical applications, including tiny object tracking and motion detection from noisy complex images, videos for cancer research, and inverse modeling of cellular forces.([MEMTrack-AISY’24](https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/aisy.202300590), [DLFM-PNAS'25](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.24.513423v2))
- **Foundation models** for aquatic science, modeling lake dynamics from real-world sensor data, with a focus on pretraining strategies and handling highly sparse observational data. ([LakeFM-ICMLW’25](https://openreview.net/forum?id=hxMPNdhfIO))
- **Vision-language models** for open-world scene graph generation ([OWSGG-CVPRW’25](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08189)), biological trait prediction ([VLM4Bio-NeurIPS’24](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2024/file/eced4a5fbc776e81b45e2f72447f0164-Paper-Datasets_and_Benchmarks_Track.pdf)), and equation discovery from visual inputs.

During my PhD, I have interned as a Machine Learning Engineer Intern (MLE) at [Twitter](https://about.twitter.com/en), [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/) and [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/). Prior to starting my PhD, I worked as a full-time ML Engineer at [HP](https://www.hp.com/us-en/home.html), and hold a Bachelor’s in Electronics and Communication Engineering from [Manipal Institute of Technology, Manipal, India](https://manipal.edu/mit.html).
