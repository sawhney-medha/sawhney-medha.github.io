  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

	abstract = {Through force exertion, cells actively engage with their immediate fibrous extracellular matrix (ECM) environment, causing dynamic remodeling of the environment and influencing cellular shape and contractility changes in a feedforward loop. Controlling cell shapes and quantifying the force-driven dynamic reciprocal interactions in a label-free setting is vital to understand cell behavior in fibrous environments but currently unavailable. Here, we introduce a force measurement platform termed crosshatch nanonet force microscopy (cNFM) that reveals new insights into cell shape-force coupling. Using a suspended crosshatch network of fibers capable of recovering in vivo cell shapes, we utilize deep learning methods to circumvent the fiduciary fluorescent markers required to recognize fiber intersections. Our method provides high fidelity computer reconstruction of different fiber architectures by automatically translating phase-contrast time-lapse images into synthetic fluorescent images. An inverse problem based on the nonlinear mechanics of fiber networks is formulated to match the network deformation and deformed fiber shapes to estimate the forces. We reveal an order-of-magnitude force changes associated with cell shape changes during migration, forces during cell-cell interactions and force changes as single mesenchymal stem cells undergo differentiation. Overall, deep learning methods are employed in detecting and tracking highly compliant backgrounds to develop an automatic and label-free force measurement platform to describe cell shape-force coupling in fibrous environments that cells would likely interact with in vivo.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

Tracking bacteria in complex environments such as polysaccharides (agar) or protein (collagen) hydrogels is a challenging task due to the lack of visually distinguishable features between bacteria and surrounding environment, making state-of-the-art methods for tracking easily recognizable objects such as pedestrians and cars unsuitable for this application. We propose a novel pipeline for detecting and tracking bacteria in bright-field microscopy videos involving bacteria in complex backgrounds. Our pipeline uses motion-based features and combines multiple models for detecting bacteria of varying difficulty levels. We apply multiple filters to prune false positive detections, and then use the SORT tracking algorithm with interpolation in case of missing detections. Our results demonstrate that our pipeline can accurately track hard-to-detect bacteria, achieving a high precision and recall.},

      abstract={Tracking microrobots is challenging, considering their minute size and high speed. As the field progresses towards developing microrobots for biomedical applications and conducting mechanistic studies in physiologically relevant media (e.g., collagen), this challenge is exacerbated by the dense surrounding environments with feature size and shape comparable to microrobots. Herein, we report Motion Enhanced Multi-level Tracker (MEMTrack), a robust pipeline for detecting and tracking microrobots using synthetic motion features, deep learning-based object detection, and a modified Simple Online and Real-time Tracking (SORT) algorithm with interpolation for tracking. Our object detection approach combines different models based on the object's motion pattern. We trained and validated our model using bacterial micro-motors in collagen (tissue phantom) and tested it in collagen and aqueous media. We demonstrate that MEMTrack accurately tracks even the most challenging bacteria missed by skilled human annotators, achieving precision and recall of 77% and 48% in collagen and 94% and 35% in liquid media, respectively. Moreover, we show that MEMTrack can quantify average bacteria speed with no statistically significant difference from the laboriously-produced manual tracking data. MEMTrack represents a significant contribution to microrobot localization and tracking, and opens the potential for vision-based deep learning approaches to microrobot control in dense and low-contrast settings.

In biomedical applications, this challenge is exacerbated by the dense surrounding environments with feature sizes and shapes comparable to microrobots. Herein, Motion Enhanced Multi-level Tracker (MEMTrack) is introduced for detecting and tracking microrobots in dense and low-contrast environments. Informed by the physics of microrobot motion, synthetic motion features for deep learning-based object detection and a modified Simple Online and Real-time Tracking (SORT)algorithm with interpolation are used for tracking. MEMTrack is trained and tested using bacterial micromotors in collagen (tissue phantom), achieving precision and recall of 76 and 51, respectively. Compared to the state-of-the-art baseline models, MEMTrack provides a minimum of 2.6-fold higher precision with a reasonably high recall. MEMTrack's generalizability to unseen (aqueous) media and its versatility in tracking microrobots of different shapes, sizes, and motion characteristics are shown. Finally, it is shown that MEMTrack localizes objects with a root-mean-square error of less than 1.84‚ÄâŒºm and quantifies the average speed of all tested systems with no statistically significant difference from the laboriously produced manual tracking data. MEMTrack significantly advances microrobot localization and tracking in dense and low-contrast settings and can impact fundamental and translational microrobotic research.},
