Two posters accepted at CVPR 2025 Workshop - 1) *"Physics-guided Diffusion Neural Operators for Solving Forward and Inverse PDEs"* , 2) *"Scientific Equation Discovery using Modular Symbolic Regression via Vision-Language Guidance"*! Excited to share that we’ll also be giving a lightning talk at the workshop—looking forward to the discussion!
